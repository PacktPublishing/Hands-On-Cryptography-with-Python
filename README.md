## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
 alpha = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
 str_in = raw_input("Enter message, like HELLO: ")

 n = len(str_in)
 str_out = ""

 for i in range(n):
    c = str_in[i]
    loc = alpha.find(c)
    print i, c, loc, 
    newloc = loc + 3
    str_out += alpha[newloc]
    print newloc, str_out

 print "Obfuscated version:", str_out
```
